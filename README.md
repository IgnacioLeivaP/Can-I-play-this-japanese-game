# Can I Play This Japanese Game?

**Can I Play This Japanese Game?** is a web-based database designed to help gamers determine the playability of Japanese Super Famicom (SFC) and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) games for non-Japanese speakers. The website provides comprehensive information about the language barriers of individual games, classifying their playability into categories based on text relevance and language requirements.

## Game Database
A growing collection of titles, currently focused on **Super Famicom (SFC)** and **Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)** games. In the future, the database will expand to include other platforms. Each entry includes metadata such as:

- **Playability Classification**: Indicates whether the game is "Fully Playable," "Partially Playable," or "Not Playable" in English.
- **Genres and Tags**: Helps users find games by type or category.
- **Exclusivity Status**: Notes whether the game was only released in Japan or had international versions.
- **Developer and Publisher Information**: Provides historical context and recognition for the teams behind the games.
- **Release Dates**: Learn when each title debuted.
- **Comments**: Detailed explanations of why a game is classified in a particular playability category (e.g., "No relevant text" or "Significant Japanese text").

## Getting Started
The website is live and accessible via [this link](https://www.canilpaythisjapanesegame.com).

The project is powered by a structured dataset that catalogs games based on their playability for English speakers. By combining research, gameplay testing, and community input, it aims to provide an accurate, reliable guide for retro gaming enthusiasts.

## Playability Categories
- **Fully Playable**: No essential Japanese text; gameplay can be fully understood without prior knowledge of the language.
- **Partially Playable**: Some Japanese text, but the game remains largely understandable through context or basic knowledge of Japanese.
- **Not Playable**: Significant Japanese text crucial for progression or understanding.

## Community Voting System
The platform includes a voting system that allows users to suggest and vote on playability reclassifications for games. This feature ensures that the database stays accurate and reflects the experiences of the gaming community.

- **Propose Reclassifications**: Users can vote for alternative classifications to change a gameâ€™s playability category if they feel it has been misclassified.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Other users can upvote any of the three options. When one of them reaches 50 votes, the system automatically updates the game, and a message about the reclassification appears. This system only works one time; if there are significant votes for another classification afterward, the team will manually review it.
- **Transparency**: Each proposal includes an explanation for the suggested change, ensuring transparency and informed decisions.
